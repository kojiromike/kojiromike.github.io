	<h1>Brand-Driven Development</h1>
	<p>I hate brands. Well, actually I love brands, but I hate that I love them, you know? Brands are the face in front of those manipulative marketing schemes like Facebook's emotion-tampering experiment[1], the discontinuity behind Vans Star Wars shoes (what?) and quite frequently the only actual value add for what would otherwise be a commodity product. (I'm like <em>yo, that's $50 for a t-shirt</em>.) Brands aren't just for commerce though. Now we have <em>personal brands</em> and we even brand programming paradigms and development practices. Branding development practices is important because it helps us communicate the value of the practice to businesspeople (read: our bosses) when we can't communicate the more technical ideas behind it. That's a powerful capability for non-technical people, but it's dangerous for technologists &ndash; brands are always more valuable for the producer than for the recipient.</p>
	<p>A brand provides a platform for software, literature, media and personal expertise in a subject
	<p><p>The brand of a technology paradigm such as "Agile" project management can lead to brittle Brands create value = books, automatons; rules and rigid/brittle processes</p>
	<p>Brands are more valuable for the people spreading them than for the people receiving.</p>
	<p>Brands as a mode of communication / mass thought/ meme makes it harder for the brand to evolve. I say "Test Driven Development" and you think I'm doing something from 1995, but I have a very different thing in mind.</p>
	<p>As a black-box abstraction for good ideas, brands provide value.</p>
